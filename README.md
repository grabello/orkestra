# Orkestra

Enterprise Job Orchestration Platform (Portfolio Project)

Orkestra is a portfolio-grade orchestration system that executes **DAG-based workflows**
with persistent state, retries with exponential backoff, idempotency, and basic saga-style
compensation. Designed to feel like an internal platform built by a B2B infrastructure team.

## Repository layout
- `backend/` Spring Boot backend (Gradle multi-module, Java 21)
- `frontend/` React ops console (Vite)
- `infra/` LocalStack (local DynamoDB + SQS) + Terraform (future)
- `docs/` Architecture notes / ADRs (future)
- `samples/` Sample workflow definitions & curl scripts (future)

## IntelliJ import (recommended)
1. **File → Open** and select the repo root folder: `orkestra/`
2. In the Gradle tool window: **Add/Link Gradle Project** → select `orkestra/backend`
   - IntelliJ will import the backend multi-modules under `backend/modules/*`
3. The `frontend/`, `infra/`, `docs/`, and `samples/` folders will still appear in the Project view,
   even though only `backend/` is a Gradle build.

> Note: IntelliJ project files under `.idea/` are included only as a convenience for local dev.
> They are intentionally minimal and may be regenerated by IntelliJ on import.

## Local dev (draft)
### Start LocalStack
```bash
cd infra
docker compose up -d
```

### Run backend
```bash
